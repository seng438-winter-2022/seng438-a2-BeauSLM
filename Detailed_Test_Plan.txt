Through reading the requirements for each of the chosen methods to be tested, 
we have decided upon each method being tested based on 3 parameters. The first
will be to use boundary values for the return values, this often results in
the maximum and minimum values for the data types that are returned by each method.
Following the two max. and min. tests, a test will be conducted to prove that the 
method is presumably functional for any values between the minimum and maximum. 

Methods that contain paramter inputs, for example the method 
calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column), will require extra tests that ensure the 
inputs are congruent with eahcother and if a parameter is out of bounds the application will 
not continue to calculate results.
